# Project Report
## Title: A Comprehensive Analysis and Interpretation of U.S. Severe Weather Events by Region and Phenomena

## Introduction
Severe weather events such as tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and snowstorms have far-reaching impacts on communities across the United States. Understanding the frequency, distribution, and consequences of these events is essential for effective disaster preparedness and risk mitigation. This project utilizes data from the Storm Event Database maintained by the National Weather Service to analyze storm events by type, time, and location.

The study aims to uncover trends and patterns in storm activity and assess the human and economic toll of different weather phenomena.

## Objectives
- To identify the most common types of storm events and their distribution across U.S. states and counties.
- To examine seasonal and yearly trends in storm occurrences.
- To evaluate the severity of storms based on fatalities, injuries, and economic damage.
- To explore relationships between storm characteristics (e.g., magnitude, type, location) and their impacts.
- To provide visual and statistical insights that support preparedness and policy planning

## Research Questions:
- Geographic Patterns
  - Which U.S. states report the highest number of storm events?
  - Are certain counties or regions consistently affected by specific storm types?
  - How does the frequency of storm events vary by climate zone?

- Temporal Trends
  - How has the number of storm events changed from year to year?
  - Which months show peak activity for major storm types like tornadoes, floods, and hail?
  - Are there observable shifts in the seasonal patterns of storms over time?

- Severity and Impact
  - Which event types result in the most injuries and deaths?
  - What is the total economic impact (property and crop damage) by storm type and state?
  - Are there specific states where damage costs are disproportionately high compared to the number of events?

- Relationships and Correlations
  - Is there a correlation between storm magnitude and reported damage or fatalities?
  - Do certain types of storms tend to co-occur, or follow each other within short time periods?(e.g., heavy rainfall followed by flooding)

- Predictive/Exploratory
  - Can storm severity or damage be predicted based on event type, location, and season?
  - What are the key factors (e.g., time of year, region, event type) that most influence storm-related fatalities or damage?
